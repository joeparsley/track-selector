        <div class="col-md-6">
          <div class="init-hidden" id="ruby-track">
            <h1>Ruby/Rails</h1>
            <p>Well there, <span class="user-name"></span>  It seems like the Ruby/Rails track at Epicodus might be right for you! Ruby is a favorite language of developers building interactive web applications. If an app involves users creating accounts, entering information, and interacting with dynamic content, there's a good chance it is built with Ruby. Ruby became popular because the Rails framework, which is written with Ruby, simplified many of the common tasks associated with building web applications. It's most popular with startups and smaller companies who are looking to build their product quickly.

            Though each language has its niche, there is plenty of crossover. For example, Rails' popularity inspired copycats in just about every language, and so you'll see interactive web applications written in C#, Java, and PHP, with Rails-like frameworks including .NET MVC, Spring, and Laravel. Even at one company, you might find them using PHP for their marketing site, Ruby for their web application, and Java for their back-end processing. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="init-hidden" id="php-track">
            <h1>PHP/Drupal</h1>
            <p>Hmmmmm... Interesting... Well, <span class="user-name"></span> It seems like you might enjoy the PHP/Drupal track at Epicodus! PHP is most used in content-heavy websites with relatively little user interaction. The most popular content management systems - Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla - are all written in PHP, and everything from local restaurants' websites up through large complex government deployments are built with these tools. If you're keen to work for an agency that builds websites for clients, or if you like the idea of building out sites for brands, businesses, and organizations, PHP is a great direction to go.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="init-hidden" id="java-track">
            <h1>Java/Android</h1>
            <p>Ahhhh, yes that makes sense <span class="user-name"></span> . you're probably gonna like the Java/Android track at Epicodus. Java is also a favorite of enterprise companies, but its appeal is broader as well: it's one of the most popular of all programming languages, and it's used in everything from for high-performance processing to building Android user interfaces. Because Java has been very popular for a very long time and is used in so many applications, it is also a very high-demand language. If you're interested in working for an enterprise-level company, as an Android developer, or in high-performance applications, Java could be a good language to learn.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="init-hidden" id="css-track">
            <h1>CSS/Design</h1>
            <p>An eye for looks eh' <span class="user-name"></span> ? Looks like you would love the CSS/Design track at Epicodus. On this track you're going to learn the ins and outs of JavaScript and CSS. You will also learn how to use Sketch3 an open source web design software that is incredibly powerful. If you love thinking about how a website looks, or the way the layout flows, or the colors, or the fonts, ... well, you get the point! This is going to be the track for you! I've just finished my second week of this track and look at the cool thing that I made, that you're using! </p>
          </div>
          <div class="init-hidden" id="csharp-track">
            <h1>C#/.NET</h1>
            <p>Well, <span class="user-name"></span> it looks like you're a problem solver and you don't care how programs look. You would be perfect for the C#/.NET track at Epicodus! C# is most popular among bigger established businesses, often for building internal software. Because it's been around for a long time and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the most in-demand languages in the job market. C# has also been going through a bit of a rebirth lately, with Microsoft open sourcing the language and surrounding platform, porting it to run on Mac and Linux, and incorporating many of the best features of other languages. If you like the idea of working for a larger company on business software, C# is a great choice. </p>
